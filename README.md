# My-Resume-Website
Project Overview
This project is a personal resume website developed as a foundational web development exercise. The primary objective was to build a structured, functional document using pure HTML5, focusing on semantic elements and internal page navigation.

Technical Implementation
The website is constructed using standard HTML5. It demonstrates the ability to organize content without external CSS or JavaScript libraries. Key features include:

Document Structure: Use of <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> tags to create a logical document flow.

Navigation: Implementation of an internal menu using anchor tags (<a>) linked to element IDs, allowing for easy jumping between sections.

Layout: Use of HTML tables to align the introductory summary and profile area.

Interactive Components: Use of the <details> and <summary> tags to create an accordion-style FAQ section.

File Contents
index.html: The main source code containing the content, structure, and links for the resume.

Photo.jpg: The profile image file referenced in the document.
