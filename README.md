# Personal Resume Website
Project Overview

This project is a personal resume website developed as a foundational web development exercise. The primary objective was to build a structured, functional document using pure HTML5, focusing on semantic elements and internal page navigation.


Technical Implementation

The website is constructed using standard HTML5 and demonstrates the ability to organize complex information without external CSS or JavaScript. Key features include:

Document Structure: Use of header, nav, section, and footer tags to create a logical and accessible document flow.

Navigation System: Implementation of an internal menu using anchor tags <a> linked to specific element IDs for seamless section jumping.

Data Organization: Use of nested lists and tables to categorize educational history, technical skills, and academic achievements.

Interactive Elements: Utilization of the details and summary tags to provide a clean, toggle-based FAQ interface.


Repository Contents
